# bulk · stars — 스타 목록 일괄 분석 (구 totally-analysis-based-on-star)

You are a stars-driven open-source bulk analyst. Given a `pub-star-classifier` output Markdown file (or a pair of files to diff), drive the entire wvs-review structure + commercial + guide workflow across every repo in the file, with category-aware bucketing and rank-aware quality tiers.

## Argument Parsing Rules (must be processed before analysis begins)

Parse the following options from `$ARGUMENTS`. Long form (`--key value`) and short form (`--key=value`) both accepted. Unknown args become positional inputs.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--input <path>` | required if no positional | Path to the latest pub-star-classifier MD (e.g. `output_test/WisemanLim-stars-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`). |
| `--previous <path>` | none | Prior pub-star-classifier MD. If given, the run analyses only repos that are **new** since the previous file. |
| `--out <dir>` | `.review` | Output root. Category subdirs + rank buckets are created under this. |
| `--bucket-thresholds <a,b>` | `100,500` | Top-bucket cutoffs. With `100,500` the buckets become `top100/`, `top101~500/`, `top501~/`. |
| `--depth <mass|deep|hybrid>` | `hybrid` | `mass` = templated 4-files-per-repo only. `deep` = LLM-authored 4-files-per-repo for every target. `hybrid` = mass for all + LLM overlay for ranks 1-5/category. |
| `--deep-top-per-cat <N>` | `5` | When `--depth=hybrid`, how many top repos per category receive LLM overlay. |
| `--workers <N>` | `8` | Concurrent shallow-clone workers for the mass tier. |
| `--force` | `false` | If set, re-emit files even when they already exist. |
| `--pdf <true|false>` | `false` | If true, after writing each MD also emit a PDF of the same base name. |
| `--no-summary` | `false` | Skip the final cross-repo summary file. |
| `--dry-run` | `false` | Print the plan + per-category counts, write nothing. |

Examples:

| Arguments | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--input stars.md` | Hybrid run on every repo in `stars.md`. |
| `--input new.md --previous old.md` | Hybrid run on **diff only** (repos starred since `old.md`). |
| `--input stars.md --depth mass` | Templated 4 files per repo, no LLM overlay. |
| `--input stars.md --depth deep --deep-top-per-cat 10` | LLM 4 files for every repo (expensive); fall back to top-10/cat if budget bounded. |
| `--input stars.md --out review-2026Q2 --pdf true` | Custom output root + PDF for every file. |

**All analysis outputs must be written in Korean and, when feasible, also in English.** Bilingual sections are explicitly required by `guide` (references/guide.md); the other docs may be Korean-primary with English glosses on technical terms.

Filename slug rules:
1. Default: `<short-repo-name>` (everything after the last `/`).
2. If two repos in the same `<category>/<bucket>/` produce the same slug (case-folded, e.g. `bip39` vs `BIP39`), prefix with the owner: `<owner>__<name>`.
3. macOS APFS is case-insensitive by default — always compare case-folded for collisions, even if FS appears case-sensitive.

---

## Execution Plan

Follow steps in order. Each numbered step has explicit success criteria.

### Step 1 — Parse inputs

1. Read `--input` MD. Detect category section headers shaped like `### <name> (<count>)` (e.g. `### 시스템 인프라 (268)`).
2. For each `| [<owner>/<repo>](<url>) | <desc> | <lang> | <stars> | <updated> | <license> |` row, extract owner_repo, url, desc, lang, stars, updated, license, and current category.
3. Assign `rank` = `1`-based index within category (already sorted by stars desc in the MD).
4. Write `<out>/_meta/repos.json` keyed by category.

If `--previous` given:
5. Repeat (1)–(4) for previous MD → `<out>/_meta/repos_previous.json`.
6. Compute `new_repos` = repos in current not present in previous (compare by `owner_repo`). Write `<out>/_meta/new_repos.json`. Restrict the rest of the run to these repos.

✅ Success: JSON files exist; total repo count matches the `총 레포: N` line in the MD.

### Step 2 — Determine buckets

For each repo, derive `bucket` from `rank`:

```
if rank <= thresholds[0]:                  bucket = "top100"
elif rank <= thresholds[1]:                bucket = "top101~500"
else:                                      bucket = "top501~"
```

Create `<out>/<category>/<bucket>/` directories as needed.

### Step 3 — Mass tier (templated)

Run only when `--depth` is `mass` or `hybrid`.

Per repo, **without consuming GitHub REST rate limit**:

1. Shallow, blob-less clone:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 --filter=blob:none --no-checkout --quiet <url> /tmp/repo_<slug>
   ```
2. From the clone, attempt to read these README candidates in order (first hit wins):
   ```
   README.md  README.MD  Readme.md  readme.md
   README.rst  README.txt  README.adoc  README
   docs/README.md  doc/README.md
   ```
   Use `git -C /tmp/repo_<slug> show HEAD:<candidate>` so partial-clone respects the `--filter=blob:none` budget.
3. Remove the clone (`rm -rf /tmp/repo_<slug>`).
4. Emit 4 files into `<out>/<category>/<bucket>/`:
   - `<slug>_REVIEW.md` — matches `structure` (references/structure.md) skeleton.
   - `<slug>_REVIEW-InDepth.md` — matches `commercial` (references/commercial.md) skeleton.
   - `<slug>_Guide4Junior.md` — matches `guide` (references/guide.md) skeleton (bilingual).
   - `<slug>_IMP-Guide.md` — applicability/integration guide.
5. Use the source MD's metadata (lang, stars, updated, license, desc) plus the README excerpt to fill the templates. Always include `> Source: <url>`, `> Category: <category>`, `> Generated: <ISO date>` header block.
6. Run with `--workers N` ThreadPool. Throttle nothing — GitHub anonymous git protocol has its own limits separate from API rate.

✅ Success: every repo has 4 files. Slug collisions resolved by owner-prefix rule (Step 0). `<out>/_meta/progress.json` updated with `{owner_repo: {status, rank, ts}}` per 25 finished repos so the run is resumable.

### Step 4 — Deep tier (LLM overlay)

Run when `--depth` is `deep` (every repo) or `hybrid` (top-N per category, N = `--deep-top-per-cat`).

1. Pick targets per category by rank.
2. Dispatch one Claude sub-agent per batch of 3–6 repos. Each sub-agent:
   - Shallow-clones each repo (same flags as Step 3).
   - Reads README + ARCHITECTURE/CONTRIBUTING/docs, lists top-level dirs, peeks at build configs (`Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, etc.).
   - **Writes each of the 4 files immediately after analyzing that single repo. Do not batch all writes for the end.** This is the single most common failure mode — agents that over-explore exhaust their step budget before any Write.
   - Removes the clone.
3. The 4 file slot names are the same as Step 3 — the LLM writes overwrite the templates. Use evidence from the clone (real file paths, version pins, dependency lists, architecture call-outs). No marketing tone, no emoji, no generic boilerplate.
4. If a sub-agent reports completion but the files still match the template (line count ≈ template size, no clone-derived evidence), **re-dispatch that group with a tighter scope (2–3 repos per agent)**.

CRITICAL agent instructions to include in every dispatch:
> `<base>` is a **file prefix**, not a directory. Write `<base>_REVIEW.md` directly into the parent dir. Do NOT create a subdir named `<base>`.

If sub-agents create nested `<base>/<base>_*.md` paths anyway, run a flatten pass:
```bash
for d in <out>/*/top*/<base>; do
  parent=$(dirname "$d"); base=$(basename "$d")
  for f in "$d"/${base}_*.md; do [ -f "$f" ] && mv -f "$f" "$parent/"; done
  rmdir "$d" 2>/dev/null
done
```

✅ Success: target repos have files whose line count and content meaningfully exceed the templates and reference real artifacts.

### Step 5 — Top-N bucket maintenance

If `--bucket-thresholds` changes between runs (e.g., switching from `100,500` to `50,200`), the worker may need to migrate files between buckets. Always re-derive buckets per repo from the current run; remove stale per-category bucket dirs that have no files.

### Step 6 — Summary (skip if `--no-summary`)

Write `<out>/_summary/SUMMARY.md`:
- Per-category counts (mass + deep + total)
- Top-3 stars per category (link to its REVIEW file)
- Diff section if `--previous` given (added / removed / promoted across buckets)
- License distribution by category

Write `<out>/_summary/SUMMARY-InDepth.md`:
- Cross-cutting commercialization signals (license risk concentration, single-maintainer clusters, BUSL/AGPL flags)
- Tech-stack centroid per category
- Open issues per category to investigate (TODO list)

### Step 7 — Optional PDF

If `--pdf true`, for every emitted `.md` produce a sibling `.pdf` (same basename, `.pdf` extension) using whatever PDF tool the host has (`pandoc`, `wkhtmltopdf`, `md-to-pdf`). Do not fail the whole run on PDF errors; log them in `<out>/_meta/worker.log` and continue.

### Step 8 — Reporting

End-of-run report (printed, not written to disk unless `--no-summary` is false):

```
TOTAL repos:        <N>
NEW since previous: <M>
Files written:      <N * 4>
Deep-overlay repos: <K>
Skipped (existing): <S>
Failures:           <F>
Duration:           <T>
```

Then list any failures with reason (e.g. clone failure, render error, slug collision unresolved).

## Reference Skill Mapping

This command **composes** three sibling skills. Treat their templates as the canonical structure for each output file:

| Output file | Reference skill | Korean sections | English sections |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_REVIEW.md` | `structure` (references/structure.md) | required | required |
| `_REVIEW-InDepth.md` | `commercial` (references/commercial.md) | required | required |
| `_Guide4Junior.md` | `guide` (references/guide.md) | required | required (per section, bilingual) |
| `_IMP-Guide.md` | this command (no peer) | required | recommended |

Each output file must include this front block:

```
# <owner>/<repo> — <doc type>

> Source: <url>
> Category: <category>  ·  Rank in category: <rank>
> Generated: <ISO timestamp>
```

---

## Failure Modes & Guardrails

- **GitHub REST rate limit**: never use `gh api` for mass enrichment. Always prefer anonymous git-over-HTTPS via `git clone --depth=1 --filter=blob:none`.
- **Slug collisions**: case-fold before comparing. macOS APFS is case-insensitive by default — `LLM` and `llm` collide.
- **Agent over-exploration**: if an LLM batch is sized > 6 repos, agents often explore until step budget exhausts without writing. Cap at 3–6 repos per sub-agent and require "write after each repo".
- **Nested subdir bug**: agents that misinterpret `<base>` as a directory create `<base>/<base>_*.md`. Always run the flatten pass after deep-tier dispatches.
- **Idempotency**: re-runs without `--force` must skip repos whose 4 files already exist. The mass tier driver maintains `<out>/_meta/progress.json` for this.
- **Korean filesystem paths**: category names contain non-ASCII characters. Quote all paths in shell ops; never let them traverse a tool that strips Unicode.

---

## Quality Bar

- Every claim in every file must be sourced from the clone, the source MD, or named explicitly as inference (`inferred from category/stars/last-push`).
- No emoji.
- No "this awesome project" marketing tone.
- Mass-tier templates must include real README excerpts (≤ 4 KB, trimmed at a clean boundary).
- Deep-tier outputs must reference at least 3 real artifacts (file paths, package names, version pins).

---

## Output Contract

When the run completes successfully:

1. `<out>/_meta/repos.json` exists and reflects the input MD.
2. `<out>/<category>/<bucket>/` populated as described in **Output Layout**.
3. `<out>/_summary/SUMMARY.md` and `SUMMARY-InDepth.md` exist (unless `--no-summary`).
4. No commits, no pushes — only files under `<out>/` are touched.
5. End-of-run report printed to stdout.

When invoked with `--previous`, the run is **incremental** by design: only diff repos are processed, and the existing `<out>/` directory is preserved.
